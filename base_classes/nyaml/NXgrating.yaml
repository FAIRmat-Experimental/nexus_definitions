NXgrating(NXobject):
  angles(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANGLE
    doc: | 
      Blaze or trapezoidal angles, with the angle of the upstream facing edge listed first. Blazed gratings can be identified by the low value of the first-listed angle.

  period(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: | 
      List of polynomial coefficients describing the spatial separation of lines/grooves as a function of position along the grating, in increasing powers of position. Gratings which do not have variable line spacing will only have a single coefficient (constant).

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.
      
      .. todo':'':'
        Add a definition for the reference point of a bending grating.
