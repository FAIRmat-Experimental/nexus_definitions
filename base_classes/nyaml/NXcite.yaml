  A literature reference
  
  Definition to include references for example for detectors,
  manuals, instruments, acquisition or analysis software used.
  
  The idea would be to include this in the relevant NeXus object':'
  ':'ref':'`NXdetector` for detectors, ':'ref':'`NXinstrument` for instruments, etc.

      This should describe the reason for including this reference.
      For example':' The dataset in this group was normalised using the method
      which is described in detail in this reference.
  url(NX_CHAR):

      URL referencing the document or data.
  doi(NX_CHAR):

      DOI referencing the document or data.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
