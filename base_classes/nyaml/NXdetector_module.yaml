  Geometry and logical description of a detector module. When used, child group to NXdetector.
  
  Many detectors consist of multiple
  smaller modules. Sometimes it is important to know the exact position of such
  modules.
  This is the purpose of this group. It is a child group to NXdetector.
  
  Note, the pixel size is given as values in the array fast_pixel_direction and slow_pixel_direction.

type: group
NXdetector_module(NXobject):
  data_origin(NX_INT):
    doc: |       
      A dimension-2 or dimension-3 field which gives the indices
      of the origin of the hyperslab of data for this module in the
      main area detector image in the parent NXdetector module.
      
      The data_origin is 0-based.
      
      The frame number dimension (np) is omitted.  Thus the
      data_origin field for a dimension-2 dataset with indices (np, i, j)
      will be an array with indices (i, j), and for a dimension-3
      dataset with indices (np, i, j, k) will be an array with indices
      (i, j, k).
      
      The ':'ref':'`order <Design-ArrayStorageOrder>` of indices (i, j or i, j, k) is slow to fast.
  data_size(NX_INT):
    doc: |       
      Two or three values for the size of the module in pixels in
      each direction. Dimensionality and order of indices is the
      same as for data_origin.
  module_offset(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      Offset of the module in regards to the origin of the detector in an
      arbitrary direction.
    \@transformation_type:
      enumeration: [translation]
    \@vector:
      type: NX_NUMBER
      doc: |         
        Three values that define the axis for this transformation
    \@offset:
      type: NX_NUMBER
      doc: |         
        A fixed offset applied before the transformation (three vector components).
    \@offset_units:
      type: NX_CHAR
      doc: |         
        Units of the offset.
    \@depends_on:
      type: NX_CHAR
      doc: |         
        Points to the path of the next element in the geometry chain.
  fast_pixel_direction(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      Values along the direction of ':'ref':'`fastest varying <Design-ArrayStorageOrder>`  ':'index':'`pixel direction<dimension; fastest varying>`. Each value in this
      array is the size of a pixel in the units specified. Alternatively, if only one
      value is given, all pixels in this direction have the same value. The direction
      itself is given through the vector attribute.
    \@transformation_type:
      enumeration: [translation]
    \@vector:
      type: NX_NUMBER
      doc: |

    \@offset:
      type: NX_NUMBER
      doc: |         
        A fixed offset applied before the transformation (three vector components).
    \@offset_units:
      type: NX_CHAR
      doc: |         
        Units of the offset.
    \@depends_on:
      type: NX_CHAR
      doc: |         
        Points to the path of the next element in the geometry chain.
  slow_pixel_direction(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      Values along the direction of ':'ref':'`slowest varying<Design-ArrayStorageOrder>` ':'index':'`pixel direction<dimension; slowest varying>`. Each value in this
      array is the size of a pixel in the units specified. Alternatively, if only one
      value is given, all pixels in this direction have the same value. The direction
      itself is given through the vector attribute.
    \@transformation_type:
      enumeration: [translation]

    \@offset:
      type: NX_NUMBER

        Points to the path of the next element in the geometry chain.
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      Points to the start of the dependency chain for this module.

      .. index':'':' plotting
      
      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
