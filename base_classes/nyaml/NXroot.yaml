      Declares which ':'ref':'`NXentry` group contains
      the data to be shown by default.
      It is used to resolve ambiguity when
      more than one ':'ref':'`NXentry` group exists.
      The value ':'ref':'`names <validItemName>` the default ':'ref':'`NXentry` group.  The
      value must be the name of a child of the current group. The child must be a
      NeXus group or a link to a NeXus group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
