  For more complex geometries, ':'ref':'`NXaperture` should be used.

      Points to the path of the last element in the geometry chain that places
      this object in space.
      When followed through that chain is supposed to end at an element depending
      on "." i.e. the origin of the coordinate system.
      If desired the location of the slit can also be described relative to
      an NXbeam, which will allow a simple description of a non-centred pinhole.
      
      The reference direction of the pinhole is parallel with the z axis. The reference
      point of the pinhole is its center in the x and y axis. The reference point on the z axis is the
      plane which overlaps the side of the opening of the pin hole pointing towards the source (minus on the z axis).

      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
