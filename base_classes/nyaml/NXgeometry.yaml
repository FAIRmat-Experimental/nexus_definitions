  legacy class - recommend to use ':'ref':'`NXtransformations` now
  
  It is recommended that instances of ':'ref':'`NXgeometry` be converted to
  use ':'ref':'`NXtransformations`.
  
  This is the description for a general position of a component.
  It is recommended to name an instance of ':'ref':'`NXgeometry` as "geometry"
  to aid in the use of the definition in simulation codes such as McStas.
  Also, in HDF, linked items must share the same name.
  However, it might not be possible or practical in all situations.

      an additional reference point for components rather than the
      location of a real component.

      Position of the component along the beam path. The sample is at 0, components upstream
      have negative component_index, components downstream have positive

      .. index':'':' plotting
      
      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
