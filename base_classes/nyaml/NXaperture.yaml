  A beamline aperture. This group is deprecated, use NXslit instead.

    doc: |       
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.
      
      The reference point of the aperture is its center in the x and y axis. The reference point on the z axis is the
      surface of the aperture pointing towards the source.
      
      In complex (asymmetic) geometries an NXoff_geometry group can be used to provide an unambiguous reference.

      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
  (NXgeometry):
    deprecated: Use the field `depends_on` and ':'ref':'`NXtransformations` to position the aperture and ':'ref':'`NXoff_geometry` to describe its shape

          * description of terms is poor and leaves much to interpretation
          * Describe what is meant by translation _here_ and ...
          * Similar throughout base classes
          * Some base classes do this much better
          * Such as where is the gap written?

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
