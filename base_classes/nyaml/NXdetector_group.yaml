  Logical grouping of detectors. When used, describes a group of detectors.
  
  Each detector is represented as an NXdetector
  with its own detector data array.  Each detector data array
  may be further decomposed into array sections by use of
  NXdetector_module groups.  Detectors can be grouped logically
  together using NXdetector_group. Groups can be further grouped
  hierarchically in a single NXdetector_group (for example, if
  there are multiple detectors at an endstation or multiple
  endstations at a facility).  Alternatively, multiple
  NXdetector_groups can be provided.
  
  The groups are defined hierarchically, with names given
  in the group_names field, unique identifying indices given
  in the field group_index, and the level in the hierarchy
  given in the group_parent field.  For example if an x-ray
  detector group, DET, consists of four detectors in a
  rectangular array':'':'

  We could have':'':'

  group_names(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      An array of the names of the detectors given in NXdetector
      groups or the names of hierarchical groupings of detectors
      given as names of NXdetector_group groups or in
      NXdetector_group group_names and group_parent fields as
      having children.
  group_index(NX_INT):
    doc: |       
      An array of unique identifiers for detectors or groupings
      of detectors.
      
      Each ID is a unique ID for the corresponding detector or group
      named in the field group_names.  The IDs are positive integers
      starting with 1.

  group_parent(NX_INT):
    doc: |       
      An array of the hierarchical levels of the parents of detectors
      or groupings of detectors.
      
      A top-level grouping has parent level -1.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
