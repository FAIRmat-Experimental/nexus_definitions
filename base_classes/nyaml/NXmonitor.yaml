  A monitor of incident beam data.
  
  It is similar to the ':'ref':'`NXdata` groups containing
  monitor data and its associated dimension scale, e.g. time_of_flight or
  wavelength in pulsed neutron instruments. However, it may also include
  integrals, or scalar monitor counts, which are often used in both in both
  pulsed and steady-state instrumentation.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.
      
      The reference plane of the monitor contains the surface of the detector that faces the source
      and is the entry point of the beam. The reference point of the monitor in the x and y axis is
      its centre on this surface. The reference plane is orthogonal to the the z axis and the
      reference point on this z axis is where they intersect.

      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
