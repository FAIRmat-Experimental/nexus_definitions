  Group of multiple application definitions for "multi-modal" (e.g. SAXS/WAXS) measurements.
  
  ``NXsubentry`` is a base class virtually identical to ':'ref':'`NXentry`
  and is used as the (overlay) location for application definitions.
  Use a separate ``NXsubentry`` for each application definition.
  
  To use ``NXsubentry`` with a hypothetical application definition
  called ``NXmyappdef``':'
  
  * Create a group with attribute ``NX_class="NXsubentry"``
  * Within that group, create a field called ``definition="NXmyappdef"``.
  * There are two optional attributes of definition':' ``version`` and ``URL``
  
  The intended use is to define application definitions for a
  multi-modal (a.k.a. multi-technique) ':'ref':'`NXentry`.
  Previously, an application definition
  replaced ':'ref':'`NXentry` with its own definition.
  With the increasing popularity of instruments combining
  multiple techniques for data collection (such as SAXS/WAXS instruments),
  it was recognized the application definitions must be entered in the NeXus
  data file tree as children of ':'ref':'`NXentry`.

      Declares which ':'ref':'`NXdata` group contains the data
      to be shown by default.
      It is used to resolve ambiguity when
      one ':'ref':'`NXdata` group exists.
      The value ':'ref':'`names <validItemName>` the default ':'ref':'`NXentry` group.  The
      value must be the name of a child of the current group. The child must be a
      NeXus group or a link to a NeXus group.

      plottable data, see the

      This is the flightpath before the sample position. This can be determined by a chopper,
      by the moderator or the source itself. In other words':' it the distance to the component
      which gives the T0 signal to the detector electronics. If another component in the
      NXinstrument hierarchy provides this information, this should be a link.
