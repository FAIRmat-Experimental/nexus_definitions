  A neutron optical element to direct the path of the beam.
  
  ':'ref':'`NXguide` is used by neutron instruments to describe
  a guide consists of several mirrors building a shape through which
  neutrons can be guided or directed. The simplest such form is box shaped
  although elliptical guides are gaining in popularity.
  The individual parts of a guide usually have common characteristics
  but there are cases where they are different.
  For example,  a neutron guide might consist of 2 or 4 coated walls or
  a supermirror bender with multiple, coated vanes.
  
  To describe polarizing supermirrors such as used in neutron reflection,
  it may be necessary to revise this definition of ':'ref':'`NXguide`
  to include ':'ref':'`NXpolarizer` and/or ':'ref':'`NXmirror`.
  
  When even greater complexity exists in the definition of what
  constitutes a *guide*,  it has been suggested that ':'ref':'`NXguide`
  be redefined as a ':'ref':'`NXcollection` of ':'ref':'`NXmirror` each
  having their own ':'ref':'`NXgeometry` describing their location(s).
  
  For the more general case when describing mirrors, consider using
  ':'ref':'`NXmirror`.
  
  NOTE':' The NeXus International Advisory Committee welcomes
  comments for revision and improvement of
  this definition of ':'ref':'`NXguide`.

  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.
      
      The entry opening of the guide lies on the reference plane. The center of the opening on that plane is
      the reference point on the x and y axis. The reference plane is orthogonal to the z axis and is the
      reference point along the z axis. Given no bend in the guide, it is parallel with z axis and extends
      in the positive direction of the z axis.

      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
