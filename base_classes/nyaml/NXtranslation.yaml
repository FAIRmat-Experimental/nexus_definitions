      This field describes the lateral movement of a component.
      The pair of groups NXtranslation and NXorientation together
      describe the position of a component.
      For absolute position, the origin is the scattering center (where a perfectly
      aligned sample would be) with the z-axis pointing downstream and the y-axis
      pointing gravitationally up. For a relative position the NXtranslation is
      taken into account before the NXorientation. The axes are right-handed and
      orthonormal.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
