  An unvalidated set of terms, such as the description of a beam line.
  
  Use ':'ref':'`NXcollection` to gather together any set of terms.
  The original suggestion is to use this as a container
  class for the description of a beamline.
  
  For NeXus validation, ':'ref':'`NXcollection` will always generate
  a warning since it is always an optional group.
  Anything (groups, fields, or attributes) placed in
  an ':'ref':'`NXcollection` group will not be validated.
