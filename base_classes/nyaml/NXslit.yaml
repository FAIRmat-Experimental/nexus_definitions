  A simple slit.
  
  For more complex geometries, ':'ref':'`NXaperture` should be used.

      Points to the path of the last element in the geometry chain that places
      this object in space.
      When followed through that chain is supposed to end at an element depending
      on "." i.e. the origin of the coordinate system.
      If desired the location of the slit can also be described relative to
      an NXbeam, which will allow a simple description of a non-centred slit.
      
      The reference plane of the slit is orthogonal to the z axis and includes the
      surface that is the entry surface of the slit. The reference point of the slit
      is the centre of the slit opening in the x and y axis on the reference plane.
      The reference point on the z axis is the reference plane.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.

      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
