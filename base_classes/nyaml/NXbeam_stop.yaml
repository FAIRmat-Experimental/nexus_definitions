  A device that blocks the beam completely, usually to protect a detector.
  
  Beamstops and their positions are important for SANS
  and SAXS experiments.

NXbeam_stop(NXobject):
  (NXgeometry):
    deprecated: Use the field `depends_on` and ':'ref':'`NXtransformations` to position the beamstop and NXoff_geometry to describe its shape instead

      engineering shape, orientation and position of the beam stop.

      This group describes the shape of the beam line component
  (NXcylindrical_geometry):
    exists: ['min', '0']
    doc: |       
      This group is an alternative to NXoff_geometry for describing the shape
      of the beam stop.
  size(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      Size of beamstop. If this is not sufficient to describe the beam stop use
      NXoff_geometry instead.
  x(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      x position of the beamstop in relation to the detector.
      Note, it is recommended to use NXtransformations instead.
  y(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      y position of the beamstop in relation to the detector.
      Note, it is recommended to use NXtransformations instead.
  distance_to_detector(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      distance of the beamstop to the detector.
      Note, it is recommended to use NXtransformations instead.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.
      
      The reference point of the beam stop is its center in the x and y axis. The reference point on the z axis is the
      surface of the beam stop pointing towards the source.

  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |       
      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
