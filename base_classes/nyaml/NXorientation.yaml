      The orientation information is stored as direction cosines. The direction cosines will
      be between the local coordinate directions and the reference directions (to origin or
      relative NXgeometry). Calling the local unit vectors (x',y',z') and the reference unit
      vectors (x,y,z) the six numbers will be [x' dot x, x' dot y, x' dot z, y' dot x, y' dot
      y, y' dot z] where "dot" is the scalar dot product (cosine of the angle between the unit
      vectors). The unit vectors in both the local and reference coordinates are right-handed
      and orthonormal.
               
      The pair of groups NXtranslation and NXorientation together
      describe the position of a component.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
