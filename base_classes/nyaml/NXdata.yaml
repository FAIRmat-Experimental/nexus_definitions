  ':'ref':'`NXdata` describes the plottable data and related dimension scales.
  
  .. index':'':' plotting
  
  It is strongly recommended that there is at least one ':'ref':'`NXdata`
  group in each ':'ref':'`NXentry` group.
  Note that the fields named ``AXISNAME`` and ``DATA``
  can be defined with different names.
  (Upper case is used to indicate that the actual name is left to the user.)
  The ``signal`` and ``axes`` attributes of the
  ``data`` group define which items
  are plottable data and which are *dimension scales*, respectively.
  
  ':'ref':'`NXdata` is used to implement one of the basic motivations in NeXus,
  to provide a default plot for the data of this ':'ref':'`NXentry`.  The actual data
  might be stored in another group and (hard) linked to the ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
  
  * Each ':'ref':'`NXdata` group will define one field as the default
    plottable data.  The value of the ``signal`` attribute names this field.
    Additional fields may be used to describe the dimension scales and
    uncertainities.
    The ``auxiliary_signals`` attribute is a list of the other fields
    to be plotted with the ``signal`` data.
  * The plottable data may be of arbitrary rank up to a maximum
    of ``NX_MAXRANK=32`` (for compatibility with backend file formats).
  * The plottable data will be named as the value of
    the group ``signal`` attribute, such as':'':'
    
      data':'NXdata
        @signal = "counts"
        @axes = "mr"
        @mr_indices = 0
        counts':' float[100]  --> the default dependent data
        mr':' float[100]  --> the default independent data
    
    The field named in the ``signal`` attribute **must** exist, either
    directly as a NeXus field or defined through a link.
  
  * The group ``axes`` attribute will name the
    *dimension scale* associated with the plottable data.
  
  If available, the standard deviations of the data are to be
  stored in a data set of the same rank and dimensions, with the name ``errors``.
  
  * For each data dimension, there should be a one-dimensional array
    of the same length.
  * These one-dimensional arrays are the *dimension scales* of the
    data,  *i.e*. the values of the independent variables at which the data
    is measured, such as scattering angle or energy transfer.
  
  .. index':'':' link
  .. index':'':' axes (attribute)
  
  The preferred method to associate each data dimension with
  its respective dimension scale is to specify the field name
  of each dimension scale in the group ``axes`` attribute as a string list.
  Here is an example for a 2-D data set *data* plotted
  against *time*, and *pressure*.  (An additional *temperature* data set
  is provided and could be selected as an alternate for the *pressure* axis.)':'':'
  
    data_2d':'NXdata

      data':' float[1000,20]
      pressure':' float[20]
      temperature':' float[20]
      time':' float[1000]
  
  .. rubric':'':' Old methods to identify the plottable data
  
  There are two older methods of associating
  each data dimension to its respective dimension scale.
  Both are now out of date and
  should not be used when writing new data files.
  However, client software should expect to see data files
  written with any of these methods.
  
    * One method uses the ``axes``
      attribute to specify the names of each *dimension scale*.
  
    * The oldest method uses the ``axis`` attribute on each
      *dimension scale* to identify
      with an integer the axis whose value is the number of the dimension.
  
  .. index':' !plot; axis label
     plot, axis units
     units
     dimension scale
  
  Each axis of the plot may be labeled with information from the
  dimension scale for that axis.  The optional ``@long_name`` attribute
  is provided as the axis label default.  If ``@long_name`` is not
  defined, then use the name of the dimension scale.  A ``@units`` attribute,
  if available, may be added to the axis label for further description.
  See the section ':'ref':'`Design-Units` for more information.
  
  .. index':' !plot; axis title
  
  The optional ``title`` field, if available, provides a suggested
  title for the plot.  If no ``title`` field is found in the ':'ref':'`NXdata`
  group, look for a ``title`` field in the parent ':'ref':'`NXentry` group,
  with a fallback to displaying the path to the ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
  
  NeXus is about how to find and annotate the data to be plotted
  but not to describe how the data is to be plotted.

      An axis slice is specified using a field named ``AXISNAME_indices``
      as described below (where the text shown here as ``AXISNAME`` is to be
      replaced by the actual field name).
      
      When no default axis is available for a particular dimension
      of the plottable data, use a "." in that position.

      Since there are three items in the list, the *signal* field
      must be a three-dimensional array (rank=3). The first dimension
      is described by the values of a one-dimensional array named ``time``
      while the other two dimensions have no fields to be used as dimension scales.
      
      See examples provided on the NeXus wiki':'

      If there are no axes at all (such as with a stack of images),
      the axes attribute can be omitted.

      Each ``AXISNAME_indices`` attribute indicates the dependency

      The first index of an array is ``0`` (zero).
      
      Here, *AXISNAME* is to be replaced by the name of each
      field described in the ``axes`` attribute.

      This attribute is to be provided in all situations.
      However, if the indices attributes are missing
      (such as for data files written before this specification),
      file readers are encouraged to make their best efforts
      to plot the data.
      Thus the implementation of the
      ``AXISNAME_indices`` attribute is based on the model of
      "strict writer, liberal reader".
