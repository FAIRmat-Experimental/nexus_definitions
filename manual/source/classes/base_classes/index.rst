:ref:`NXstage_lab`
    Candidate class for a component or a set of components which is coarse-grained into one logical unit. The role of the stage in an experiment is to hold/align/orient the sample/specimen and eventually offer a controlled environment and further devices to apply stimuli. Having an own candidate class is justified as contemporary specimen/sample stages are such multi-purpose/-functional tools with multiple actuators, sensors, components, and thus also the need to store the various (meta)data that are generated with manipulating the sample. Modern stages realize a hierarchy of components for achieving these tasks. For example the specimen might be mounted on a multi-axial tilt rotation holders which itself is fixed in the support unit that connects to the microscope. In other examples, taken from atom probe microscopy for instance, researchers may work with wire samples which are clipped into a larger fixing unit for convenience. This unit is known in atom probe jargon as a stub. Stubs in turn are positioned on pucks. Pucks are then loaded onto carousels. This NXstage class reflects two layers of this hierarchy. The stage is the root of the hierarchy. A stage carries the holder. In the case that it is not practical to distinguish these two layers, the holder should be given preference. Applied to examples, a nanoparticle is attached on a copper grid. The copper grid is the holder. The grid itself is fixed to the stage. An atom probe specimen is fixed in a stub, in this case the stub can be considered as the holder, while the cryostat temperature control unit reads more as the stage. A microtip on a microtip array is an example of a three-layer hierarchy commonly employed for efficient sequential processing of atom probe experiments. For a single experiment though only one microtip of the array at a time can be measured. Therefore, the microtip is the specimen, the array the holder and the remaining mounting unit that is attached to the cryo-controller the stage. To cover for an as flexible design of these complex lab-like modern stages users should nest NXstage_lab objects for reflect the differences between e.g. a holder and a stage.

:ref:`NXtransformations`
    Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe a geometry.

    legacy class - (used by :ref:`NXgeometry`) - general spatial location of a component.

:ref:`NXuser`
    Contact information for a user.  

:ref:`NXvelocity_selector`
    A neutron velocity selector
