  Application definition for a STXM instrument.
  
  The interferometer
  position measurements, monochromator photon energy values and
  detector measurements are all treated as NXdetectors and stored
  within the NXinstrument group as lists of values stored in
  chronological order. The NXdata group then holds another version
  of the data in a regular 3D array (NumE by NumY by NumX, for a
  total of nP points in a sample image stack type scan). The former
  data values should be stored with a minimum loss of precision, while
  the latter values can be simplified and/or approximated in order to
  fit the constraints of a regular 3D array. 'Line scans' and 'point spectra'
  are just sample_image scan types with reduced dimensions in the same way
  as single images have reduced E dimensions compared to image 'stacks'.

              Detector data should be presented with the first dimension corresponding to the
                                 scan point and subsequent dimensions corresponding to the output of the detector.
                                 Detectors that provide more than one value per scan point should have
                                 a data array of rank 1+d, where d is the dimensions of the array provided per
                                 scan point. For example, an area detector should have an NXdetector data array
                                 of 3 dimensions, with the first being the set of scan points and the latter
                                 two being the x- and y- extent of the detector.

          Detectors that provide more than one value per scan point should be summarised
                       to a single value per scan point for this array in order to simplify plotting.
                       
                       Note that 'Line scans' and focus type scans measure along one spatial dimension
                       but are not restricted to being parallel to the X or Y axes. Such scans
                       should therefore use a single dimension for the positions along the spatial
                       line. The 'sample_x' and 'sample_y' fields should then contain lists of the
                       x- and y-positions and should both have the 'axis' attribute pointing to the same dimension.
