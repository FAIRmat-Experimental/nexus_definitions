          This is I(Q). The client has to analyse the dimensions
          of I(Q). Often, multiple I(Q) for various environment
          conditions are measured; that would be the first
          dimension. Q can be multidimensional, this accounts for
          the further dimensions in the data
        dimensions:
          rank: 3
          dim: [[1, nVars], [2, nQX], [3, nQY]]
