  This is the application definition for S(Q,OM) processed data.
  
  As this kind of data is in
  general not on a rectangular grid after data reduction, it is stored as Q,E positions plus their
  intensity, table like. It is the task of a possible visualisation program to regrid this data in
  a sensible way.
