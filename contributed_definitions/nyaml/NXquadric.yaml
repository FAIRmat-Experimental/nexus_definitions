      Ten real values of the matrix that defines the quadric surface
      in projective space. Ordered Q11, Q12, Q13, Q22, Q23, Q33, P1,
      P2, P3, R. Takes a units attribute of dimension reciprocal
      length. R is scalar. P has dimension reciprocal length, and the
      given units. Q has dimension reciprocal length squared, and
      units the square of those given.
