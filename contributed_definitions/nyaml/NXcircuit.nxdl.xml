        <doc>
             (Signals Periods) The Signals Period is the rate at which the signals are
             transferred to the host computer running the control software. This is usually
             lower by a factor of 10 than the sampling rate, because an internal oversampling
             of the signal is done on the real time engine. You can reduce the oversampling
             down to 1 in order to resolve higher frequencies in the Spectrum Analyzer.

             Update rate for several processes like History Graph, Auto-Approach, and for
             many Programming Interface functions. This is usually set to 20 ms. All
             additional timings (7-9) can only be integer multiples of this value. They can
             be set to different values, but the actual timing value will be coerced to a
             multiple of the Acquisition Period.

    <field name="Animations Period" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
        <doc>
             Update rate of animated graphical indicators. These are e.g. some graphs &amp;
             sliders. A reasonable value is 40 ms (25 updates per second). Increase this
             period to reduce the processor load for the graphical user interface, especially
             on slow computers. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does
             not affect measurements in any way.

    <field name="Indicators Period" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
        <doc>
             Update rate of digital indicators, e.g. the numbers displayed besides each
             slider. Here, 3 updates per second, or 300 ms is enough. This value is purely a
             user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.

    </field>
    <field name="Measurements Period" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
        <doc>
             The Measurements period is the integration time for precise measurements
             (averaging over specified period), mostly used in sweep modules. Examples are
             recording of a force-distance curve or a resonance of a cantilever. For fast
             measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be reasonable. For normal
             use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a resonance of a high-Q
             cantilever, values of several seconds might be necessary. Usually this parameter
             doesnâ€™t need to be set from this module; the sweep modules will set this value
             according to the sweep timings.
