  Metadata of a dataset (tomographic reconstruction) in atom probe microscopy.
# symbols:
NXapm_input_reconstruction:
  filename:
    doc: |
      Name of the (NeXus)/HDF5 file which stores reconstructed ion position
      and mass-to-charge-state ratios. Such an HDF5 file can store multiple
      reconstructions. Using the information within the dataset_name fields
      is the mechanism whereby paraprobe decides which reconstruction to
      process. With this design it is possible that the same HDF5
      file can store multiple versions of a reconstruction.
    \@version:
      doc: |
        Version identifier of the file (representing an at least SHA256 strong)
        hash. Such hashes serve reproducibility as they can be used for tracking
        provenance metadata in a workflow.
  dataset_name_reconstruction:
    doc: |
      Name of the dataset inside the HDF5 file which refers to the
      specific reconstructed ion positions to use for this analysis.
  dataset_name_mass_to_charge:
    doc: |
      Name of the dataset inside the HDF5 file which refers to the
      specific mass-to-charge-state-ratio values to use for this analysis.
