          Ideally program version plus build number, or commit hash or description
          of ever persistent resources where the source code of the program and
          build instructions can be found so that the program can be configured
          ideally in such a manner that the result of this computational process
          is recreatable in the same deterministic manner.

        Ideally, a (globally persistent) unique identifier for referring

        This process identifies which of the points/ions in the datasets are
        inside or on the surface of geometric primitives and meet optionally
        specific other filtering constraints.
        A typical use case of a roi_selection is to restrict analyses to
        specific regions of the dataset, eventually regions with a complicated
        shape.
