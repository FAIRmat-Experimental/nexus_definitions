  Container for reporting a set of secondary electron images.
  
  Secondary electron images are one of the most important signal especially
  for scanning electron microscopy in materials science and engineering, for
  analyses of surface topography, getting an overview of the analysis region,
  or fractography.

symbols: 
  n_images: |

  n_y: |     
    Number of pixels along the slow scan direction (often y).

  n_x: |     
    Number of pixels along the fast scan direction (often x).

      Tilt correction is an option offered by most control software of SEMs
      to apply an on-the-fly processing of the image to correct for
      the excursion of objects when characterized with SE images
      on samples whose surface normal is tilted about an axis perpendicular
      to the optical axis.
